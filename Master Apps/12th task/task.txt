This challenge will check your knowledge about handling events. Your starting point is the page below:


<body>
 <i class="fas fa-ghost"></i>
</body>
and this style:

.fa-ghost{
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  font-size: 30px;
  transition: all .3s;
}
Your task is to write a script that moves the ghost below after clicking corresponding key on a keyboard.

After every click of the arrow on the keyboard:

left arrow - reduce the left value by 3%
right arrow - increase the left value by 3%
top arrow - reduce the top value by 3%
bottom arrow - increase the top value by 3%
Additionally, when after clicking on the ghost an alert with "Buuuuuu!" text should appear. Before you start, add Font Awesome to the page, using this link.
